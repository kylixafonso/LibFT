# libft
My take on libft, the first 42 project:
Libft is a custom library that every cadet at 42 has to program for themselves.
It's the first project of the inner circle and without it you cannot advance in the 42 course.
Considering how much the Piscineux taught me, I found this project to be reasonably easy but still fun!
If you are a student at 42, feel free to look at my code if it might help you a little, just don't copy + paste :)
